#include QMK_KEYBOARD_H

// Implements cmd-tab like behaviour on a single key. On first tap of trigger
// cmdish is held and tabish is tapped -- cmdish then remains held until some
// other key is hit or released. For example:
//
//     trigger, trigger, a -> cmd down, tab, tab, cmd up, a
//     nav down, trigger, nav up -> nav down, cmd down, tab, cmd up, nav up
//
// If Shift is held while trigger is pressed, sends Shift+Tab for reverse direction.
//
// This behaviour is useful for more than just cmd-tab, hence: cmdish, tabish.

    uint16_t cmdish,
    uint16_t tabish,

    keyrecord_t *record
);

// To be implemented by the consumer. Defines keys that should not interrupt
// the swapper when active (e.g., shift keys for changing direction).
